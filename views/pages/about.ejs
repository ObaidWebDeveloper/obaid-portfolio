        <h2>web development (fullstack)</h2>
        <p>
            I am a web developer and a full-stack developer, but I really enjoy working on the backend, such as creating
            databases and building large-scale backend websites. I have developed many websites, including clones of
            Facebook and WhatsApp, and I love creating such clones. However, I haven't just built clones; I have also
            developed many websites from scratch.

            I have also created my personal websites, <a href="https://obaidwebdev-pk.rf.gd"
                target="_blank">ObaidWebDeveloper</a> and <a href="https://devscriptspace.rf.gd"
                target="_blank">DevScriptSpace</a> Most of the time, I have
            used PHP for backend development, but recently, I have started using Node.js, which I find amazing.

            I don't have any certificates, but I have completed a comprehensive web development course and learned a
            lot. I
            don't believe that certificates hold much importance in today's modern world—what truly matters is having
            strong
            skills, not just a certificate.

        <h2>seo (Search Engine Optimization)</h2>
        <p>
            I have worked extensively in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and have achieved significant progress in this
            field. One of the biggest challenges I faced in SEO was my free domain, which required much more effort
            compared
            to a normal paid domain. However, I didn’t give up—I worked hard and successfully ranked my website at the
            top.

            Additionally, I have also made great progress in ranking competitive keywords and have successfully
            positioned
            my pages to compete with other websites.

            I am very passionate about SEO, and I optimize every website I develop. My ultimate goal is to achieve top
            rankings so that I can also become an expert in marketing.

        <h2>designing (canva or svg)</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned a lot in designing. It all started back in 2014 when I first stepped into designing through
            painting. At that time, I didn’t know much and used to do painting on my PC just to pass the time. However,
            gradually, I moved to Adobe Photoshop and started understanding things better.

            After a long break, I resumed designing and created several projects on <b>Canva</b>, receiving great
            responses
            from clients, which made me very happy. My first online income also came from designing, and that’s how my
            journey began.

            Apart from <b>Canva</b>, I have also gained expertise in <b>SVG</b>, which is widely used in website design.
            I have
            learned a lot in this field and developed strong skills over time.
